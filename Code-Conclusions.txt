'''After completing the downsampling, the Decision Tree Classifier had an 
f1 test score of 0.582 which occured with high recall of 0.628 and low precision of 0.541. 
This means this model is good at having fewer false negatives, but has more false positives. 
The Random Forest Classifier's f1 test score was 0.576 with a recall score of 0.596 and a precision score of 0.558. 
This means the random forest is more balanced, but is slightly more common to have false positives, 
and fewer false negatives, but not by a lot. 
In final, both models would likely need higher upsampling to increase recall.'''
